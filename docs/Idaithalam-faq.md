4. **<span style="color:#800040">How to make Orchestration of APIs ? (or)     Management of Excel(Need of multiple sheets?) and maintenance efforts with more than 200 test cases?
    </span>**<span style="color:#004080 ">
    - Executing each API and validating it's response can be added in the single row in the excel sheet, which will be generated as gherkin Scenario. 

    - All apis(Gherkin scenarios/All excel rows) in a single sheet would be generated as Gherkin Feature. This sheet(gherkin Feature) would perform an API Workflow Execution.

    - Each sheet in the excel creates a separate Gherkin feature(Feature file).

    - Each Excel sheet transformed as **Virtualan Collection**(JSON Array) before it generated as Gherkin Feature. and Each JSON Object referred to as row in the excel which is Gherkin Scenario.
